# SOM JS

This project is based on a wonderful Self Organizing Map tuturial written in C++ then JAVA, and now Typescript and React.
http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html  

Install with yarn or npm.

`yarn start` builds a webserver serving the interesting page at localhost:3000.

Once running, visit the website and click on the text labeled "RUN" to begin the training process.

This alogrithm groups like vectors together in 2 dimensional space. This program groups the swatches seen.
